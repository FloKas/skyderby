## Why Skyderby exists?

In April 2014 I finally got the GPS tracker. After a couple of wingsuit jumps with it I wanted to check my results and faced the following problem: all existing services (free or commercial) didn’t show any results at all or showed it in a very uncomfortable way. 

So I decided to create a new application.
